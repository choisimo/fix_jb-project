# Roboflow Completion Plan

## Business Requirements
1. Add 8 missing object classes to detection model:
   - Fallen trees
   - Flooded areas
   - Damaged signs
   - Landslides
   - Streetlight outages
   - Sewer issues
   - Graffiti
   - Abandoned vehicles
2. Implement confidence-based prioritization system
3. Connect department routing to GIS geographic data
4. Achieve >90% detection accuracy for critical infrastructure issues

## Technical Specifications
1. **Model Expansion:**
   - Dataset: 500+ images per new class
   - Augmentation: Rotation, brightness, contrast variations
   - Architecture: YOLOv8 with transfer learning
   - Training cycles: 3 iterations with progressive refinement

2. **Confidence-Based Prioritization:**
   - Critical: >90% confidence (immediate action)
   - High: 75-90% (24h response)
   - Medium: 50-75% (72h response)
   - Low: <50% (manual review)

3. **GIS Integration:**
   - GeoJSON boundary files for 12 administrative districts
   - Reverse geocoding API for coordinate-to-address conversion
   - Department mapping table:
     | District  | Department       | Contact         |
     |-----------|------------------|-----------------|
     | Wansan-gu | Infrastructure   | 063-123-4567    |
     | Deokjin-gu| Environment      | 063-234-5678    |

4. **Performance Targets:**
   - mAP: 0.85+ for all classes
   - Inference time: <500ms per image
   - False positive rate: <5%

## Integration Points
1. Roboflow API endpoints
2. GIS boundary service
3. Department database
4. Priority calculation service
5. Ticket management system (Jira/ServiceNow)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. 95% detection accuracy for new classes in validation set
2. Prioritization accuracy matches manual assessment in 90% of cases
3. Department assignment accuracy >98% for geocoded incidents
4. Model retraining cycle <24 hours
